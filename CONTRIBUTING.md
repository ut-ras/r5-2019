# Contributing to Region V
When contributing to Region V's source, please coordinate with the managers of each subsystem. If the module you are working on does not fall cleanly into an existing branch, feel free to create a new branch or coordinate to split existing development branches.

## Standards and Style
As a large project involving many people, maintaining a high standard of code hygiene is of utmost importance. Make sure you have read and understood our [style guide](https://github.com/ut-ras/r5-2019/wiki/Style-&-Standards) before committing; code with poor formatting and code without thorough documentation will not be accepted.

## How to contribute
1. Work with your team to create a commit or set of commits in your team's [branch](https://github.com/ut-ras/r5-2019/wiki/Branches).
2. Open a pull request to ```dev```, and fill out the form.
3. Wait for someone to review your code request. While anyone (other than you) can review and approve code, only administrators can merge the commit. Administrators should not merge pull requests before either performing their own code review or participating in a group review.
4. After rigorous testing, the changes will be merged into ```master```.
